TeamCity 
	-Set up CI/CD Tools & Configuration
		-TeamCity can help as it has many plugins out of the box e.g. Gradle, NodeJS, you donâ€™t need to install and configure any of those plugins.

	-Configuration as Code
		-TeamCity offers two solutions for configuration, via the UI and via the code.
	
		-Easier for more complex projects which need lots of steps.
		-Configurations can be written in Kotlin DSL, Since Kotlin is a full-fledged programming language
		-It makes it easier for developers to script their CI/CD pipelines.
	
	-Build Chains a.k.a Pipelines
		-Create build chains with your builds by defining dependencies between them , whenever you build TC will check all the dependent builds and run the first incorrect order.
		-Pass artefacts or the outputs from one build to another.
		-Runs build in parallel, for example, run the same test in a different browser or different OS, etc.
	
	-Personal builds
		-You can run builds directly from your code editor.
		-Useful to test your changes before committing and integrating them into the existing codebase.
		-It is available on popular code editors, i.e: Intellij, VS Code, Eclipse.
	
	-TeamCity Architecture
		-TeamCity Server: 
		It provides the UI for managing build configurations.
		
		-Build Agents:
		Executes build configuration or build jobs
		Connect as many as you want
		They Can be installed anywhere from on-premise, cloud providers or docker containers
		Different tools can be installed on different agents, like node, Gradle, Docker, etc.
		TC automatically detects, which build agent can execute which build based on the build configuration. 
		
	It's automation server is easy to use, configure and set up the installation and integrating with the version control systems.

	It cannot build processes for multiple branches at a time.

	It is not widely used and has fewer users. It also has less documentation on its website than competitors.

	It has a security feature by default and password masking unlike its competitors.
